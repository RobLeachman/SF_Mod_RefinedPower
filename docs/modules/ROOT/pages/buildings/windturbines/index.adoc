= Wind Turbines

## Building Information :

Wind turbines are renewable sources of power for your factory, that need no input of items.
All turbines can be daisy-chained up to 2 power lines.

## Wind Turbine Mechanics

Wind turbines have a proximity overlap reduction. This means that the power production will decrease depending on the amount of turbines within a certain radius. If there are 3 or more other identical turbines within this radius, the turbine will stop producing power.
