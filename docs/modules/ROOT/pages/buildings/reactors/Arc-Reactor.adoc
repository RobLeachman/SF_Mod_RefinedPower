= Arc Reactor

## Building Information:
Arc reactor must be provided with 20 of Advanced Reactor Core & 20m^3 Reactor Coolant before it will start. Core levels must maintain above 10, and coolant above 10m^3, otherwise the reactor will shutdown.

Once shutdown has started it cannot be switched back on until it is fully switched off.

Reactor will consume 0.25 Cores per minute at 100% utilization, and 5m^3 of coolant per minute at max capacity.

## Building Cost:
40 Supercomputers, 80 Alclad Aluminum Sheet, 60 A.I. Limiter

## Building Unlock Tier: Tier 7
